# Leaf_Disiease_ML

This approach to the popular leaf disease detection and classification problem encompasses the use of CNNs for obtaining feature maps from the images followed by the use of traditional machine learning algorithms for classification. The implementation includes the use of AlexNet for feature extraction followed by evaluating the efficacy of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes for classification.
